# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This is a simple terminal app that takes in user input and creates some SVG code that you can then use for your websites/projects! Essentially, you are creating a logo or emblem for yourself!

## Motivation
I wanted to make an easy way to create simple SVG code. This way, I can have an emblem I can code into all my projects! I also wanted to get practice with Object Oriented Programming and understanding how to integrate it.

## Installation
Fork/clone the repository to your local system. Open the code in your preferred IDE and open your integrated terminal. Run `npm i` and you're ready to go.

## Usage
After running `npm i` in your terminal, go ahead and run `node index.js`. You will then be prompted with 4 questions about how you would like your SVG to appear. A confirmation will show in the terminal, and a new file named "generatedLogo.svg" will be created. You can plug it into an index.html and open it in the browser to get a peak of how it looks!
